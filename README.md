## Applicants:
Fabio Fiori
Paloma Dominguez Sanchez
Taylor Evan Lucero
Proposal Summary
The project aims to develop a digital tool for real-time detection of students' engagement levels in online teaching environments. By combining Facial Expression Recognition CNN (FERC) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, the tool will analyze facial expressions, actions, and on-screen activity to classify engagement levels as low, normal, or high. This tool will provide valuable insights to teachers, enabling them to enhance teaching effectiveness and improve learning outcomes in online education.

## Laymen Abstract
We're building a tool to gauge how engaged students are during online classes. Using facial recognition and machine learning, our tool will analyze students' facial expressions and actions in real-time. This will help teachers understand how engaged their students are and improve their teaching methods accordingly.

## Expected Impact
Enhanced teaching effectiveness
Improved learning outcomes in online education
Valuable insights for teachers to adjust teaching strategies
